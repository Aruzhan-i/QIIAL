## Project Proposal:

### Overview:

This project is aimed at developing a mobile application focused on people's self-development.

### **Problem description:**

Nowadays, a person's self-development plays a big role in his life. It helps a person to understand the meaning of life, find a way in it, and also expands his horizons, which are the reasons for his success. A person learns many things, gets knowledge and, of course, discovers many opportunities for himself. Thus, a person developing his inner self acquires positive qualities and values that pave the way to achieve his goals and dreams. However, it's not easy to find something for self-development, because there are a million collections, a million tips, from which it takes a lot of time to choose something, and in the end, not finding anything suitable, a person abandons what he started.

### **Goal:**

To help people's self-development by providing resources such as books, podcasts, quotes, by means of a mobile application in which the main language is Kazakh.

### **Objective:**

1. Find books, podcasts, quotes to improve spiritual and self development.
2. Draw design of the mobile application and define features and functions of every page.
3. Development of the mobile application based on the design and its features.
4. Test the application to identify any errors and remove them to achieve the best quality.

### **Proposed solution:**

Solution to the problem is the mobile application for the spiritual and self- development of people, and acquisition of motivation through the resources. The application, which has Kazakh as a main language, will give an opportunity to create accounts for every user to get the access to resources and also communicate with other users. Every user can find the most suitable books, podcasts by specifying the genre and start his journey to self-development.
